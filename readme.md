1. Why is using let safer than var?
let is block-scoped, meaning it's only accessible within the block itâ€™s declared in.
var is function-scoped and can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting.
Using let prevents accidental redeclaration and scoping bugs.
It helps make your code more predictable and clean.

2. What is the main benefit of separating JavaScript from HTML?
Separating JavaScript improves code maintainability and readability.
It allows HTML and JS to evolve independently.
Promotes reusability and cleaner architecture.
Improves performance with script caching.

3. Why is Math.random() useful in games or UI effects?
Math.random() helps generate unpredictable values.
It adds variability to animations, colors, or game elements.
Useful for dice rolls, enemy movement, or loot drops.
Enhances user experience through randomness.

4. What happens if two event listeners are attached to the same element?
Both event listeners will execute when the event occurs.
They run in the order they were added.
Using addEventListener() allows multiple handlers.
This promotes modular and reusable code.

5. Why should we use functions to organize code?
Functions break code into reusable, logical blocks.
They avoid repetition and simplify debugging.
Improve code readability and structure.
Allow easier testing and maintenance.
